# Covid-19-ML-project

This is a self guided project I made to create a predictive model of COVID-19 new daily infections in the United States. The premise was to use a Recurrent Neural Network to analyze trends in infections, deaths, and testing over a period of time to predict new infections. This was accomplished by using LSTM layers being fed COVID-19 data in a time series format. Overall the project is completed, but leaves much to be desired. I am still getting used to working with time series datasets, and my data is also lacking some key features that would greatly improve the model accuracy, primarily current active cases.
